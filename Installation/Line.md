# Line Bot Setup

## Sign up line developer console

Follow [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/integrations/line) until you get the following stuff:

- Channel id (Under "Basic Settings")
- Bot token (Channel access token (long-lived), need to click claim once under "Messaging API")
- WebHookToken (Channel secret, under "Basic Settings")

# Set up certificates for HTTPS

You have to make sure that your running environment has public access, and it is also bound to a domain.

If you have your own certificate, skip this part. If not, try to use [LetEncrypt](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh).

If you are having issue in this part, follow guides on the link above.

After this part is done, more stuffs are ready:

- HTTPS CA Cert (ca.cer)
- HTTPS Private Key (example.com.key)
- HTTPS Public Key  (example.com.cer)
