UnifiedMessageRelay is a framework for the purpose of bringing messages from different chat platform together. With UnifiedMessageRelay,
user no longer need to view messages on different platform, or different groups. UnifiedMessageRelay brings powerful
 message forwarding functionality and flexible plugin API to meet your custom need. A driver API specification is also
 provided, so one can compose their own backend driver, and the framework will load and utilize the driver automatically.
